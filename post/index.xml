      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped up numerous cycles of qualitative coding of interview data for my dissertation, Into the edu-verse: New teachers’ agency in self-directed learning with social media, I used geom_tile() in {ggplot2} to create heatmap plots to help me quickly visualize how thematic codes varied by interview participant and by modality.
Codes by Participant Codes by Modality I&amp;rsquo;ve shared the code to produce these plots in a GitHub repository, and you can also view on RPubs a variety of different heatmaps I created en route to these final plots.</description>

      <description>Into the Edu-verse: Early-Career Educators Seeking Induction Support on Social Media On November 26, 2019, I successfully defended my dissertation proposal for my PhD in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology through Michigan State University&amp;rsquo;s College of Education. I have shared the full text of my proposal here: https://bretsw.github.io/dissertation-proposal-text/
You can scroll through my presentation slides for the defense below (use the arrow keys) or view them here.
 At the end of the defense, I asked my committee for advice on sustaining a project as large as the dissertation, and they offered some great wisdom.</description>

      <title>Content, Conversation, &amp; Context: How Educators Talk to Each Other in Twitter #Edchat</title>

      <description>On November 11, 2019, I gave a talk on a recent research project as part of the Educational Psychology and Educational Technology (EPET) brownbag series at Michigan State University.
Abstract Despite potential benefits, conversations on Twitter are often hard to follow. Several factors contribute: the volume of new messages, the unruly mass of content, and the mashup of features that comprise the platform. For educators to participate in professional learning on Twitter, they must be able to find coherence in these conversations.</description>

      <description>“Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.”
Picasso’s famous words were among those jumbling in my head while watching Super Bowl commercials this year. That’s right, my boyfriend was watching football; I was watching commercials. Anyway, Liam Neeson had me in stitches when he said, “BigBuffetBoy85, I’m coming for you, with lots of barbarians and dragons.” Hilarious for riffing off his Taken franchise persona to sell Clash of Clans to a new audience, but also, well, awkwardly, nervously funny because this made-up marketing scenario tapped into something deeper, something that hit me close to home.</description>
