      <description>I am currently in the midst of completing my coursework for a PhD in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology through Michigan State University&amp;rsquo;s College of Education. For now, I want to list each course, and hopefully down the road I&amp;rsquo;ll get chance to write about my experience in each.
Course department guide:
* CEP = Department of Counseling, Educational Psychology, &amp;amp; Special Education
* TE = Department of Teacher Education</description>

      <description>“Art is a lie that makes us realize truth.”
Picasso’s famous words were among those jumbling in my head while watching Super Bowl commercials this year. That’s right, my boyfriend was watching football; I was watching commercials. Anyway, Liam Neeson had me in stitches when he said, “BigBuffetBoy85, I’m coming for you, with lots of barbarians and dragons.” Hilarious for riffing off his Taken franchise persona to sell Clash of Clans to a new audience, but also, well, awkwardly, nervously funny because this made-up marketing scenario tapped into something deeper, something that hit me close to home.</description>
