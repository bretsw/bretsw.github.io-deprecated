      <description>As I&amp;rsquo;ve wrapped up numerous cycles of qualitative coding of interview data for my dissertation, Into the edu-verse: New teachersâ€™ agency in self-directed learning with social media, I used geom_tile() in {ggplot2} to create heatmap plots to help me quickly visualize how thematic codes varied by interview participant and by modality.
Codes by Participant Codes by Modality I&amp;rsquo;ve shared the code to produce these plots in a GitHub repository, and you can also view on RPubs a variety of different heatmaps I created en route to these final plots.</description>

      <description>Into the Edu-verse: Early-Career Educators Seeking Induction Support on Social Media On November 26, 2019, I successfully defended my dissertation proposal for my PhD in Educational Psychology and Educational Technology through Michigan State University&amp;rsquo;s College of Education. I have shared the full text of my proposal here: https://bretsw.github.io/dissertation-proposal-text/
You can scroll through my presentation slides for the defense below (use the arrow keys) or view them here.
 At the end of the defense, I asked my committee for advice on sustaining a project as large as the dissertation, and they offered some great wisdom.</description>
