      <description>Iâ€™ve applied for a handful of academic jobs in the past six months, as many tenure track faculty positions as I could imagine fitting my experiences and skills. In the present higher-education-during-COVID-19 reality, that has amounted to six jobs to apply to (with hopefully more posted in the coming weeks). Three of those I applied to have since been removed from consideration by university-wide hiring freezes.
Work is hard to come by nearly everywhere these days, giving me cause to pause and reflect on my professional journey to date.</description>
