      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Bret. I am an Assistant Professor of Instructional Systems &amp;amp; Learning Technologies at Florida State University.
My research investigates self-directed learning through social media. I have several ongoing projects related to this research area. First, I examine networked learning in online communities, such as those hosted by Twitter and Reddit. Second, I study how new teachers expand their professional support systems during their induction transition. Third, I explore the connections between informal learning and invisible labor.</description>
