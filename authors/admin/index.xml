      <description>Hey there, I&amp;rsquo;m Bret. Read my CV or download
I am a PhD candidate in the Educational Psychology &amp;amp; Educational Technology program at Michigan State University. My research focuses on networked learning at the intersection of information science and teacher education. Specifically, I have been exploring how social media platforms support induction and ongoing professional learning for K-20 educators. My work has been published in Journal of Research on Technology in Education, British Journal of Educational Technology, and Policy Insights from the Behavioral and Brain Sciences, among others, and I have won two Best-Paper Awards from the Society for Information Technology and Teacher Education.</description>
