      <description>The main branch of my research to date, seeking to understand the Twitter edcuational conversation #Edchat through a variety of different approaches and methods.
Understanding discourse by tweet type Learning itself is a complex process, and Twitter is a complex space. To structure and order an exmaination of learning, I am looking at whether the kind of discourse evidenced in a tweet varies by the type of tweet. The tweet type can be quickly sorted at scale with machine coding, but tweet discourse requires a much slower, more finite process of human-coded content analysis.</description>
